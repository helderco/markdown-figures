# markdown-captions

Extension for [Python-Markdown](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown) to parse images with captions inside a figure element.

## DEPRECATED

I lost interest on Markdown early on, when trying to add extensions to it, so I switched to reStructuredText. I no longer use this, but anyone is welcome to fork and maintain it. I'll gladdly but up the link here.

Thanks!
